      This Prison Offender Manager does not appear to be active</h1>
      <p>
      This Prison Offender Manager no longer has a POM role assigned to them at this prison.
      <br>
      If this POM has changed jobs, or is going to be away from work for a while, you must set their status to inactive. This will release their cases so they can be reallocated.

      <br><br>

      <a class="govuk-link" href="/prisons/LEI/poms/485752">Set this POM's status to inactive</a>
    </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you think this is a mistake</h2>
      <p>
        If this POM is still managing a caseload you, or your LSA, need to check that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <p>the correct role is assigned to the POM in Digital Prison Services</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>their NOMIS account is active and the correct roles are assigned</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>See the steps to do this in the <a href="/help_step0">Guide to getting set up</a>. You will not be able to manage or reallocate this POMs cases until their status is updated, or their roles are added correctly.</p>
